# Claude Instructions: ML Audio Classification Experiment Application

## Project Goal
Build a Kubernetes-deployable application that runs multi-factor ML experiments on audio classification models, generating ROC-AUC comparison plots across different training data sizes and species.

## Core Requirements

### Data Pipeline
- **Input**: Pull audio data from GCS bucket `dse-staff/soundhub/data/{species_name}/` (pos/neg subfolders)
- **Special case**: Perch model uses `dse-staff/soundhub/data_5s/{species_name}/` 
- **Output**: Write results to GCS bucket `dse-staff/soundhub/results/`
- **Species**: coyote, bullfrog (extensible to more)
- **Balanced sampling**: Use equal numbers of pos/neg files for training each classifier
- **Training size limits**: Maximum training size per species is constrained by `min(pos_samples, neg_samples)` to ensure balanced datasets

### ML Experiment Design
- **Models**: 5 models (birdnet, perch, vgg, mobilenet, resnet)
- **Training sizes**: 0-300 samples (configurable intervals, auto-adjusted per species based on available balanced data)
- **Cross-validation**: K-fold with set seeds for reproducibility
- **Metrics**: ROC-AUC values with confidence intervals
- **Output visualization**: Per-species charts (x=sample size, y=ROC-AUC, lines=models, error bars=CIs)

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Kubernetes-ready (Docker containerized)
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform integration
- **Code quality**: Implement linting (black, flake8, mypy), testing (pytest), proper logging
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config (12-factor app principles)
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, progress tracking, error handling with retries

## Architecture Suggestions
1. **Modular design**: Separate data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization
2. **Async processing**: Use asyncio for concurrent model training
3. **Resource management**: Memory-efficient data loading, model cleanup
4. **State management**: Checkpoint intermediate results, resume capability
5. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes jobs

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use modern Python practices (3.10+, type hints, dataclasses/pydantic)
- Implement proper error handling and logging (structlog recommended)
- Use efficient ML libraries (scikit-learn, torch, tensorflow as needed)
- Create comprehensive tests and documentation
- Follow security best practices for GCP authentication
- Optimize for both development and production environments

## Reference Code
The existing `src/` folder contains reference implementations for:
- Model loading and preprocessing approaches
- GCS integration patterns
- Configuration management
- Evaluation metrics

Feel free to redesign/refactor this codebase completely to achieve the most efficient and maintainable solution.

## Deliverables
1. Complete application source code with proper structure
2. Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests
3. Configuration files and environment setup
4. Documentation (README, API docs)
5. Tests and CI/CD pipeline suggestions
6. Performance optimization recommendations

Create a production-ready solution that follows cloud-native best practices and can scale efficiently in a Kubernetes environment.
